                <p>If you have not read a book on forming habits before, read this book. If you have, Atomic Habits will
                    probably have some practical tips but you might not find anything ground-breaking in it. </p>

                <p>Now onwards, if someone asks me whatâ€™s my favorite self help book, I know the answer: Atomic Habits
                    by James Clear.
                    Here are a few quotes I loveddd from the book. A very, very practical approach to organizing your
                    life. Recommended</p>

                    <p>,Doesn't say anything I haven't heard before.
                        James Clear needs to specify more clearly why we should listen to him... what are his actual qualifications? I'd much prefer to read a book by multiple psychologists and psychiatrists rather than from one seemingly random guy. </p>
